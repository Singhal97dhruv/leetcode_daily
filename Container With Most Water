You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.



class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int r=height.length-1;
        int i=0;
        int res=0;
        while(i<r){
            int mediate=Math.min(height[i],height[r])*(r-i);
            res=Math.max(res,mediate);
            if(height[i]<height[r])i++;
            else r--;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
